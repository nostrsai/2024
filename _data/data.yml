    title: Who is Timothy Horn?
    summary: |
      I created this resource to quickly get to know me.  If you're here it is possible I may be applying
      for a position, performing work for you, or expanding my network. I'm a local of Hampton for 10+ years 
      with experience in our local maritime/government economy.  
      
      I've worked in:
      Shipyards, on bridges, and errected a few buildings in the area while expanding my skilled trades
      experience, with ancillary experience in framing, construction and fabrication. I hold certifications such
      as C-12 C-14 C-7 (CAS-1) SSPC.ORG in the coatings industry.

      In addition to skilled trades, I have also maintained and am currently expanding my IT / Cyber security
      portfolio.  I have over 25 years experience in Information Technology, with A+ Network+ and
      Security+ certifications (CompTIA.org)

      I prefer to lead in mobilizing group efforts to maximize efficiency, and I take pride
      in my stoic work ethic.  I excell in situations which require dynamic solutions and have a
      logical, process-of-elimination mindset while executing workflows both physical and digital. When I am given
      operational control, I consistantly excel in any endeavor offering a low-risk high-reward potential to teams
      I collaborate with, employers, and in my community.  I value the right to privacy, and believe strongly in
      Proof of Work as well as Value for Value.  Increase your leverage and productivity, or simply add to your
      network or learn new things with me today, and tomorrow.
