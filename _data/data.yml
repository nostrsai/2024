career-profile:
    title: Timothy Horn - 43 - Hampton VA
    summary: |
      I started my Computer journey early, 1996. Subsequently, I have also been a part of the Shipyard industry
      in our area since 2008.  There are references both to my IT certifications, and my Protective Coatings
      certifications here. While my expertise in IT/CS has increased over 20+ years I also have the benefit
      of a handful of skilled trades, with 10-15 years experience and found dominance and a sense of contribution
      helping execute contracts at the behedst of those who serve in our Military.  I appreciate the detail of MIL
      spec standards, and find sembelance between the intricacies of IT and the specifications and standards we use
      in todays Protective Coating systems.
      
      I am in search of positions which will help me utilize my skillsets, and a positive environment where I 
      can continue my education while providing valuable work and service.
